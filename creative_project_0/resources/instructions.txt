Welcome to Connect Four!

Connect Four is a two-player connection game in which the players first choose a
color and then take turns dropping colored discs from the top into a seven-column,
six-row vertically suspended grid. The pieces fall straight down, occupying the
next available space within the column. The object of the game is to connect four
of one's own discs of the same color next to each other vertically, horizontally,
or diagonally before your opponent.

Here is how the game works:
- Player 1 selects a column to drop their disc into the grid.
- Player 2 then selects a column to drop their disc.
- Players alternate turns until one player gets four of their discs in a line or
  the grid is filled.
- If the grid is filled and no player has four discs in a line, the game is a draw.

Instructions for making a move:
1. The current state of the grid will be displayed. Each column will be numbered.
2. To make a move, enter the number of the column where you want to drop your disc.
3. Ensure to check the state of the grid before making a move to see the available
   columns.
